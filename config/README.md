The following [file](SoftwareList.md) contains the list of softwares which will be automatically installed.

If you don't want one of these, just untick the box in front of it. 

You can also remove the software from the list or add some new ones. 

Once it is done, just launch the autoInstall.sh file!

These softwares are hosted on the officials repository! You shouldn't add softwares from self-hosted sources to this list!

For self-hosted softwares, the feature is upcoming.
